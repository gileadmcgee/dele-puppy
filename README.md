Welcome to the homepage of dele-puppy, a BitShares2 witness candidate.

While voted in I will work to secure the network.  This will include at a minimum.
maintaining a functioning updated witness_node, responding to forks, and other issues in a timely manner, 
publishing feeds for bitassets, and maintaining a seed-node.  If you would like further detail feel free to read further

***committee member***
I am temporarily putting myself forward as a candidate for committee member.  Once the gui is updated to allow less technical users to complete the duties of a committee member,
and candidates have come forward, I will withdraw from this position.  If elected as a committee member I will vote to impliment the changes I beleive are neccessary to promote the health
and growth of BitShares.  As I am currently an active witness I will abstain from voting for any change in witness pay.  I do however reserve the right to vote for a change in feed
publishing fees.

Current seed-node:  	104.236.144.84:1777
Current VPS providers:  So-you-start, Digital Ocean, Amazon web services
Current feed script:  Xerocs feed script
Current failover:  No automated failover at this time due to security concerns.  Hopefully we will have a solution soon.

I am a long time BitShares supporter, and was an active delegate on BitShares 1.0.  In fact my witness was #2 in all time blocks produced at the time of the snapshot with over 38,000
blocks produced.
